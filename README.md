# About me
I am a PhD student in Cognitive Neuroscience and Neuroimaging in the Complex Cognitive Processing lab based in the Department of Psychology at the University of York.

My project focuses on the neural correlates of **scene complexity perception**, **image memorability** and **long-term visual memory for scenes** and is supervised by Dr Karla Evans and Prof Alex Wade.

Broadly I am interested in vision as a cognitive, computational and biological process that interacts with attentional- and memory-related mechanisms.
